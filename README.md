# Terminal Chat
Terminal Chat is a small terminal-based app used for messaging between devices.

# Installation and usage
As of now, just run server.py on your terminal if your computer will host the server; run client.py if you'll be client. You also need to change the server IP on each file for it to work on your own network. **Further improvements will be made to make usage easier in the future.**
